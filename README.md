# 1Bit_Full_Adder_FPGA

The Mini Hardware Project is a 50.002 Computational Structures project that involves the use of FPGA to test the function of our self-built full adder. Using Lucid on the Mojo IDE, we aim to design the FPGA such that its 3-outputs act as the 3-inputs for our full adder. This can be automatically tested with the use of Finite State Machines (FSMs) and visually seen through the LEDs on the circuit board signifies a different value, i.e. "ON" = 1, "OFF" = 0.
